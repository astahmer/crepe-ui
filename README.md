repo archived cause Chakra-ui V3 is very close and now uses the same styling API as Panda, which means you can just pick recipe/slot recipes from there and almost copy/paste components !
-> Chakra imports recipes using `useRecipe`, with Panda those will be generated in `styled-system/recipes`

ex: button recipe https://github.com/chakra-ui/chakra-ui/blob/1195171b9ec8b351daf7d36be3f012ccf63ba61d/packages/react/src/theme/recipes/button.ts
button component https://github.com/chakra-ui/chakra-ui/blob/1195171b9ec8b351daf7d36be3f012ccf63ba61d/packages/react/src/components/button/button.tsx

We only need to watch/rebuild the `packages/preset-chakra` due to using
[custom conditions](https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#conditional-exports),
since Panda doesn't support them yet.

Updating the `packages/preset-chakra` will trigger a `static.css` file
generation, which is used by the demo.

## TODO

- update Ark-UI and remove all the pasted UseXXXProps types when v1 is released

- create other frameworks implementation, only the React one is done

- for each frameworks, export 2 different versions:

  1. for Panda users, with `@crepe-ui/styled-system` as external dependency
  2. for non-Panda users, with everything bundled

- make a version of the components that is RSC-compatible = without
  `createStyleContext`
  - could use `defineParts`
  - or could just keep using slots but with explicit props passing

## Missing Chakra components

Editable, Number Input, Pin Input, Radio, Range Slider, Slider, Stat, Circular
Progress, Spinner, Toast, Highlight, Drawer, Menu, Accordion, Breadcrumb,
Stepper
